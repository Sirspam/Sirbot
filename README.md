[Discord invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=822029618969182218&permissions=313408&scope=bot)

Basically [Scuffed Bot](https://github.com/thijnmens/ScuffedBot) but adapted to work as a public bot with somewhat mediocre code.

Sirbot's main function is interaction with the [nekos.life](https://nekos.life/) API, although it does feature some other functions. 

## How to use Sirbot
Sirbot's default prefix is **.** although a server admin can change this to a custom prefix. Mentioning the bot is also a valid prefix.

The rest of the bot is just your usual discord bot, put in the prefix then the command you want. "But what commands does Sirbot have?" I hearing you asking, well that leads us onto our next header, **Sirbot Commands**.
