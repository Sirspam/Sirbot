Sirbot has been archived as I no longer want to continue this project.
As a result of a handful of issues regarding API interaction in the other cogs, I've decided to remove them all and keep the fun cog for the hosted version of Sirbot (since this bot is mainly used for cat girl pictures lmao.)

# Sirbot
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/sirspam/sirbot/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/sirspam/sirbot)

[Discord invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=822029618969182218&permissions=313408&scope=bot)

~~Sirbot's main function is interaction with the [ScoreSaber](https://scoresaber.com/) API, although it does feature some other functions.~~
Sirbot's main function is now posting pictues from the [Waifu Pics](https://waifu.pics/) API, although it does still feature some other functions, not as much as it used to though.

## How to use Sirbot
Sirbot's default prefix is **.** although a server admin can change this to a custom prefix. Mentioning the bot is also a valid prefix.

The rest of the bot is just your usual discord bot, put in the prefix then the command you want. "But what commands does Sirbot have?" I hearing you asking, well that leads us onto our next header, **Sirbot Commands**.
