# Sirbot
[Discord invite link :)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=822029618969182218&permissions=313408&scope=bot)

Basically [Scuffed Bot](https://github.com/thijnmens/ScuffedBot) but adapted to work as a public bot with somewhat mediocre code.

Sirbot's main function is interaction with the [ScoreSaber](https://scoresaber.com/) API, although it does feature some other functions.
